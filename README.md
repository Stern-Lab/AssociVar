# AssociVar
Finding associated variants in MinION data.

This is the repository accompanying the paper Sequencing Complete Genomes of RNA Viruses With MinION Nanopore: Finding Associations Between Mutations (bioRxiv 2019; DOI https://doi.org/10.1101/575480) and is subject to the paper user license.

Use the pipeline under association_tests to find the true variants in your sequencing data.
Next, use the scripts in strains_and_linkage_between_variants to find the relationship between these variants.

Example directory contains a bash script running an example of this pipeline on real data, together with the pipeline outputs and final results.
